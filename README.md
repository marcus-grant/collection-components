React Collection Components
===========================
A set of modules containing React components that are focused on creating a uniform structure when rendering UI's that are structured as one dimensional Lists or Bars, or in two dimensions Grids or Flows. And to go with this backing structure various specific compositions of these things and other code to make them better suited for specific situations like dropdown menus, sidebars, header/footer bars, galleries, carousells, cards, etc. I came from a background of iOS software development before going into Full Stack development and enjoyed the structure of Apple's Cocoa Frameworks' [`UICollectionView`][01] and its subclasses like `UITableViewController`. This is an attempt to create standard UI components in their spirit, that make sense for React's more declarative and unidirectional dataflow programming philosophies.
